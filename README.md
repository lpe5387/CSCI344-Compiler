# CSCI344-Compiler: Phase 2

For Phase 2 to run correctly with JottParserTester.java, JottParser.java should be in the "provided" package,
and SyntaxException.java should be in a package called "exceptions". Both are in "src". There is also a folder
called "treeNodes" in "src" that contains all the node classes of the parse tree.

To build the project on the command line, go into the "src" directory, and run:

javac &ast;/&ast;.java<br />
java testers.JottParserTester
