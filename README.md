# CSCI344-Compiler: Phase 4

To build and run the project on the command line, go into the "src" directory, and use the following commands:

`javac */*.java`<br />
`javac Jott.java`<br />
`java Jott <infile> <outfile> <language>`

If code was converted into C, ensure that the concat.c and concat.h files are siblings to the C file (these files are located within the src directory). To generate the executable file, use the following command:

`gcc <c_file> concat.c -o <executable_name>`
